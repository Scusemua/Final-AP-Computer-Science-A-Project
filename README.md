# Final AP Computer Science A Project

This is the source code of my final project for AP Computer Science. I took the class my sophomore year of high school (2013 - 2014). 

## Description
Basically, I was going for a drawing program with a few random features. The final product after a week's labor at about an hour a day was a drawing program far superior to any other. This program allowed you to create magnificent effects such as a brush size that changed as you painted. Additionally, it would paint in rainbow.
